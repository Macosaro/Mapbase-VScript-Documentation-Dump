# Mapbase-VScript-Documentation-Dump
If you mess around with Mapbase's VScript like me, you are in luck. I noticed that there is simply no proper documentation for VScript and decided to solve this problem myself.

All information inside this repository was extracted with `script_help` and `script_help_client` commands and reformatted with a Python script.

Feel free to reference to this repository.
